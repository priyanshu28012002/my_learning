Use `std::thread::native_handle()` to:

1. **Set the thread name** (useful for debugging)
2. **Set thread priority** (adjusts OS scheduling)
3. **Set CPU affinity** (binds thread to specific cores)
4. **Integrate with OS-specific APIs** (e.g., `pthread_*` or Windows API)

### ✅ Key Points

* **Thread Name**: `pthread_setname_np()` allows setting a descriptive name for the thread, which is useful for debugging and can be viewed in tools like `gdb` or by inspecting `/proc/self/task/[tid]/comm` on Linux systems.

* **Thread Priority**: `pthread_setschedparam()` sets the scheduling policy and priority of the thread. In this example, the thread is set to real-time priority using `SCHED_FIFO`. Note that setting real-time priorities may require appropriate privileges.

* **CPU Affinity**: `pthread_setaffinity_np()` binds the thread to a specific CPU core, which can improve performance by reducing context switching and cache misses. In this example, the thread is bound to CPU core 0.

* **OS Integration**: The use of `native_handle()` provides access to the underlying OS thread handle, enabling integration with OS-specific APIs like `pthread_*`.

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

* **Portability**: The `native_handle()` function and the associated OS-specific APIs are not portable. The above example is tailored for Linux systems. For Windows, different APIs would be used, such as `SetThreadPriority()` and `SetThreadAffinityMask()`.

* **Thread State**: Ensure that the thread is joinable before accessing its native handle. Attempting to access the native handle of a non-joinable thread can lead to undefined behavior.

* **Permissions**: Modifying thread priorities and CPU affinity may require elevated privileges, depending on the operating system's security policies.
